Things to remember when designing html layout. Have in mind how you want to page to look and create classes for each element so when you are creating the css you can easily design each class. 
Looking at how others have designed their pages (html and css) is a great help to understand better how I can create my own web pages. It helps to look at various pages to understand how they created what they created. 
Make sure when working in css to put a "." in front of the class you are designing and a ";" after each design element. 
Having access to google was helpful whenever i got stuck. Also access to "discord" was extremely helpful, I just need to remember to search the feed for answers to my questions before posting my questions. I did post a question and received very fast responses that helped me solve my problem. I had a lot of fun creating the page and feel like I need to continue to create various pages so that i can get in the habit of coming up with the code on my own without seeking ideas and help from others. I found many different websites that have really cool styling options for CSS and was able to personalize the google page more than just doing the basics. Great time and a lot of learning here. 
I can get better at breaking up my commits and focusing on one thing at a time. This habit will help me in the future when working with others on future projects.
